Implementation steps for the 2D CFAR process

Cell Under Test - Loop over elements of RDM array each iteration selecting one cell to be the CUT 
    	for i = Tr+Gr+1 : (Nr/2)-(Gr+Tr)
    	for j = Td+Gd+1 : Nd-(Gd+Td)

For each iteration loop over the training cells "excluding the guarding cells" to sum their values
        for k = i-(Tr+Gr) : i+(Tr+Gr)
        for m = j-(Td+Gd) : j+(Td+Gd)

Calculate the average of the noise value in the area around CUT
        noise_lev = noise_lev + db2pow(RDM(k,m))

Convert using pow2db
        th = pow2db(noise_lev/(2*(Td+Gd+1)*2*(Tr+Gr+1)-(Gr*Gd)-1))

Add the offset value

Offset is added to the threshold to calculate the new threshold.
Next, compare the signal under CUT against this threshold.

    If the CUT is greater then the threshold replace it by 1, else 0

Selection of Training, Guard cells and offset

    Tr = 8, Td = 8 For both Range and Doppler Training Cells.
    Gr = 12, Gd = 6 For both Range and Doppler Guard Cells.
    offset = 2 the offset value.

Steps taken to suppress the non-thresholded cells at the edges

It is suppressed that edges are zero since cell under test are not located at the edges. So, cell values assigned as zero.

RDM(union(1:(Tr+Gr),end-(Tr+Gr-1):end),:) = 0; % Rows
RDM(:,union(1:(Td+Gd),end-(Td+Gd-1):end)) = 0; % Columns
